My passion for the informatics goes **back to the '80s** when my parents bought me my first computer. With 16 years published monthly articles in two Spanish computer magazines *MSX INPUT* and *MSX CLUB*.

I began my wonderings in digital media when together with a group of friends **founded "Televisió de Sant Andreu"** which later became into the current "Barcelona Televisió BTV".

Once completed my studies in Graphic Design i started working at various advertising agencies.

Performed various tasks; from the receipt of the briefing, conception of the idea, graphical development, planning, R&D and final production.

Some of my works have been awarded in known worldwide advertising Festivals.

I am current working at @DoubleYou Spain
