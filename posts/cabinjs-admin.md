I am publishing this blog with the help of [CabinJS](http://www.cabinjs.com) a simple and extensible static site generator powered by Grunt.

Actually it is working fine but I found that the workflow is a little teddious.

I needed to manage and edit my posts in a more visual way, so I decided to make a simple CMS with my requeriments.

Acutually is a work in progress... anyway I am using it to actually publish this blog.

Technically speaking it is composed of 2 main components:

* Backend Connect Middleware to power the server side
* HTML + AngularJS + Typescript + Bootstrap to power the front end
